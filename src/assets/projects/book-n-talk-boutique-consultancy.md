## Say Hello to Book N Talk v0.1: Your Boutique Consultancy Hub

Let me tell you the story of how Book N Talk came to life.

It all started with my wife. She was happily using an old web app called Superpeer for her consultancy work. It was perfect: It let her get paid online while sharing her knowledge with clients via video calls. Then, the app was sold and eventually shut down. Poof! Gone.

And that's where the idea for Book N Talk was born. I thought: 
> "Hey, why not build a better one?"

The app, which you can find at [bookntalk.com](https://bookntalk.com), is built on that same core idea:

* **Consultants/Experts** can register and easily create their services or events.

* Customers visit a profile, book an available time slot for the desired event, and pay for it right there.

**The Elephant in the Room (Competitors)**

Let's be real, there are tons of apps out there that do the same thing. I won't lie; I'm up against some seriously big players to get Book N Talk noticed. You can find them with a quick search, but I'm not here to name my competitors!
    
    We have a saying in turkish that includes rabbit and a mountain, "The rabbit rubbed himself against the mountain and said he f*cked the mountain" hhahaha.

My goal isn't to be the biggest; it's to be the boutique shop. I'm focusing on a few things to make us stand out, especially with a fair income model.

**What's in the Initial Launch (The MVP)**

**Multitenancy for Peace of Mind:** I'm a bit security-paranoid (in a good way!). To help reduce the potential impact of any issues, I've set up your data on a separate database from everyone else's. Think of it as having your own secure little private vault.

**A Win-Win Payment Model:** This is the big one. I truly won't make a single penny unless you do!

* **How it works:** Book N Talk is token-based. You buy tokens to allow clients to book you. One booking = One token.

* If a token costs, say, €1, but your consultation is €100, my share is a tiny 1% (€1/€100). That's a pretty sweet deal, right?

* **Your money stays yours:** You just need to provide your Stripe API keys. **Your payments go directly into your account.** I'm not touching or controlling your earnings because, honestly, why would I? It's your money!

* **Free Credits—Taste Before You Buy:** I know no one wants to pay for a product they haven't tried out. So, to make sure you can get a real feel for the system and even host a few meetings for free, I'll give three free tokens to every active account each month. That's €3 from me to you every month, just for being here!

**Why the Heck Did It Take So Long?!**

Life. That's the one-word answer. 

I've postponed this launch at least ten times. Priorities shift, and I had other things I needed to accomplish at my day job. But hey, it's finally here, and that's what matters!

After that, here's what's on the roadmap:
* **Infrastructure Independence:** Right now, I rely a lot on third-party providers. I want to shift some of that, get a big server, and start running my own tools. It's about having more control and lowering those recurring costs.

* **Better Observability:** This is a fancy way of saying: "I need to know when things break." The current monitoring isn't great, so I need to implement an easy-to-use solution so I can quickly see the health of the application.

Thanks for checking out the launch!
